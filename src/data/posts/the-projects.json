Not toy projects or tutorials — production systems with real users, real integrations, and real deployment pipelines.\n\nHere's what Claude Code handles well, what it struggles with, and what surprised me about each.\n\n## the platform SaaS Platform Development\n\n:::stat{value=\"72\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nCore product development for the platform, an AI agent platform with embeddable chat, MCP tools, simulator, analytics dashboard, and Stripe Connect billing. Claude Code was used extensively for full-stack TypeScript/Next.js feature implementation including page ownership transfer, demo lobby, onboarding flows, mobile responsiveness, dark mode, evolution engine tools, and iterative bug fixing across multi-file changes. Sessions frequently followed a plan-implement-review-PR workflow with Claude handling everything from database migrations to UI polish.\n\n:::callout{type=\"insight\"}\nWith 72 sessions, this was heavy enough to reveal Claude's real strengths and weaknesses in this domain. The patterns that emerged here informed many of the tips in the [Power User Guide](/posts/power-user-tips).\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Obsidian Second Brain & Knowledge Management\n\n:::stat{value=\"28\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nBuilding and maintaining an Obsidian vault as a professional second brain for a Director of Intelligent Systems role, including org charts, vendor notes, project hubs, meeting notes, onboarding plans, and weekly report automation. Claude Code was used to scaffold vault structures, create and update interconnected markdown notes from emails and transcripts, manage frontmatter, and automate organizational knowledge capture across dozens of files per session.\n\n:::callout{type=\"tip\"}\nAt 28 sessions, the dominant pattern was rapid iteration — fixing issues as they surfaced rather than trying to prevent them upfront.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Connector & Integration Development\n\n:::stat{value=\"22\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nBuilding platform connectors and third-party integrations including a third-party service scheduling, Calendly, Google OAuth, Resend email notifications, Stripe Connect, Composio, and MCP tool wiring. Claude Code handled end-to-end implementation from planning through migration, environment configuration, and PR creation, with notable friction around timezone bugs, authentication flows, and production deployment issues requiring iterative fixes.\n\n:::callout{type=\"tip\"}\nAt 22 sessions, the dominant pattern was rapid iteration — fixing issues as they surfaced rather than trying to prevent them upfront.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Marketing Site & Content Creation\n\n:::stat{value=\"20\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nMarketing website updates, landing pages, features pages, OG images, privacy/terms pages, demo scripts, presentation decks, and a dev blog built from Claude Code session data. Claude Code was used for copy changes, Vercel deployment, responsive CSS, favicon generation, and markdown rendering, as well as generating video scripts and presentation prompts for the platform demos.\n\n:::callout{type=\"tip\"}\nAt 20 sessions, the dominant pattern was rapid iteration — fixing issues as they surfaced rather than trying to prevent them upfront.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## DevOps, Git Operations & Code Quality\n\n:::stat{value=\"36\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nGit workflow management, PR creation and review, branch operations, code review audits, deployment troubleshooting, disk space cleanup, and SMB network share configuration. Claude Code was heavily used for automated code reviews with parallel sub-agents, cherry-picks, stashing large files, architecture scoring audits, and resolving production deployment issues on Vercel including environment variable and build configuration problems.\n\n:::callout{type=\"insight\"}\nWith 36 sessions, this was heavy enough to reveal Claude's real strengths and weaknesses in this domain. The patterns that emerged here informed many of the tips in the [Power User Guide](/posts/power-user-tips).\n:::\n\n## Cross-Project Patterns\n\nAfter working with Claude across all 5 areas, a few things became clear:\n\n- **TypeScript is Claude's sweet spot.** With 4,169 file touches across the period, TypeScript/React projects had the highest success rate by far. The type system acts as a guardrail that catches Claude's mistakes early.\n\n- **Infrastructure work needs more hand-holding.** Terraform, database migrations, and deployment configs require more explicit instructions. Claude tends to make assumptions about infrastructure that are wrong.\n\n- **Integrations are surprisingly strong.** Payment systems, calendar APIs, OAuth flows, MCP servers — Claude handled these well because the APIs are well-documented and the patterns are clear.",
