  "content": "There's a version of this post that just shows you the numbers: 178 sessions, 264 commits, 974 hours, 5 projects. But numbers don't capture what it actually *feels* like to treat an AI as your primary engineering partner for two months straight.\n\nSo here's the honest version.\n\n## The Working Dynamic\n\nI'm a **high-velocity operator** who uses Claude Code as a tireless implementation partner across an impressive breadth of work — from building Obsidian second-brain vaults and onboarding plans to shipping full-stack features like Stripe Connect integrations, Calendly connectors, and Remotion video projects. With 397 sessions over roughly two months and 264 commits, I maintain a relentless pace. My dominant pattern is **giving Claude ambitious, multi-step tasks and letting it run**, then course-correcting when something goes wrong. I don't micromanage — my average of ~8 messages per session suggests I issue directives and expect execution, not hand-holding. The heavy use of Task/TaskUpdate (1,526 combined calls) confirms I frequently leverage sub-agents and parallel workflows to tackle complex, multi-file changes (107 noted successes in multi-file edits). When Claude gets stuck in planning loops — as happened with the Remotion video and dev blog sessions where it spent entire sessions reading files without producing code — **I interrupt decisively** rather than waiting.\n\nMy friction profile reveals a telling pattern: the top issues are **buggy code (55 instances) and wrong approach (51 instances)**, not misunderstandings or unclear requests. This means I'm generally clear about what I want, but I'm pushing Claude into complex enough territory that it frequently ships bugs or takes suboptimal paths — like the race condition with unawaited Supabase inserts, the UTC timezone issues in a third-party service, or the server component cookie deletion error. I handle these pragmatically, reporting the bug and expecting a fix rather than getting frustrated (only 1 frustrated session out of 489). My **satisfaction rate is remarkably high** (377 likely satisfied + 59 satisfied + 7 happy = 91% positive) despite the friction, suggesting I view Claude as a productive but imperfect collaborator whose mistakes are worth tolerating for the speed gains. I also show a strong DevOps-oriented workflow — git operations are my second most common goal, and I regularly drive full PR lifecycles (implement → review → fix → push) within single sessions.\n\nMy work spans a **distinctive mix of technical and knowledge-management tasks** that suggests a Director-level role where I'm both building product (TypeScript-heavy SaaS with 4,283 TS tool uses) and organizing my professional world (Obsidian vaults with org charts, meeting notes, vendor tracking, onboarding plans). I treat Claude Code sessions like short sprints — deploy a feature, fix a bug, create a PR, move on. When sessions drag into excessive planning, I cut them short. This is someone who has internalized that **shipping imperfect work fast and iterating is better than planning perfectly**, and I've shaped my Claude Code usage to match that philosophy.\n\n:::callout{type=\"insight\"}\n**The one-line summary:** I operate as a fast-moving executive-builder who issues ambitious multi-step directives, lets Claude execute autonomously, and intervenes surgically when it ships bugs or gets stuck in planning loops.\n:::\n\n## What This Looks Like Day to Day\n\nMost sessions follow the same arc: I describe what I want at a high level, Claude decomposes it into steps, and then we iterate. The good sessions feel like pair programming with someone who types infinitely fast. The bad sessions feel like managing a junior developer who keeps misunderstanding the architecture.\n\nThe difference between the two? Specificity. When I say \"add a delete button to the user profile with a confirmation modal that calls the existing deleteUser API endpoint,\" Claude nails it. When I say \"improve the settings page,\" Claude spends 8 minutes reading files and writing plans without producing code.\n\n## The Projects\n\n### the platform SaaS Platform Development\n:::stat{value=\"72\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nCore product development for the platform, an AI agent platform with embeddable chat, MCP tools, simulator, analytics dashboard, and Stripe Connect billing. Claude Code was used extensively for full-stack TypeScript/Next.js feature implementation including page ownership transfer, demo lobby, onboarding flows, mobile responsiveness, dark mode, evolution engine tools, and iterative bug fixing across multi-file changes. Sessions frequently followed a plan-implement-review-PR workflow with Claude handling everything from database migrations to UI polish.\n\n### Obsidian Second Brain & Knowledge Management\n:::stat{value=\"28\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nBuilding and maintaining an Obsidian vault as a professional second brain for a Director of Intelligent Systems role, including org charts, vendor notes, project hubs, meeting notes, onboarding plans, and weekly report automation. Claude Code was used to scaffold vault structures, create and update interconnected markdown notes from emails and transcripts, manage frontmatter, and automate organizational knowledge capture across dozens of files per session.\n\n### Connector & Integration Development\n:::stat{value=\"22\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nBuilding platform connectors and third-party integrations including a third-party service scheduling, Calendly, Google OAuth, Resend email notifications, Stripe Connect, Composio, and MCP tool wiring. Claude Code handled end-to-end implementation from planning through migration, environment configuration, and PR creation, with notable friction around timezone bugs, authentication flows, and production deployment issues requiring iterative fixes.\n\n### Marketing Site & Content Creation\n:::stat{value=\"20\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nMarketing website updates, landing pages, features pages, OG images, privacy/terms pages, demo scripts, presentation decks, and a dev blog built from Claude Code session data. Claude Code was used for copy changes, Vercel deployment, responsive CSS, favicon generation, and markdown rendering, as well as generating video scripts and presentation prompts for the platform demos.\n\n### DevOps, Git Operations & Code Quality\n:::stat{value=\"36\" label=\"sessions\"}:::\n\nGit workflow management, PR creation and review, branch operations, code review audits, deployment troubleshooting, disk space cleanup, and SMB network share configuration. Claude Code was heavily used for automated code reviews with parallel sub-agents, cherry-picks, stashing large files, architecture scoring audits, and resolving production deployment issues on Vercel including environment variable and build configuration problems.\n\n## The Meta-Pattern\n\nAfter 178 sessions, the pattern that matters most isn't any specific technique — it's the *speed of the feedback loop*. The faster you can tell Claude what's wrong and get a correction, the more productive you are. Every workflow optimization I've found boils down to: reduce the time between \"that's wrong\" and \"now it's right.\"",
